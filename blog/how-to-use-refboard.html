            <p>
                As a digital artist, having a well-organized reference board can make the difference between a
                frustrating creative session and a productive one. RefBoard is designed specifically to solve this
                problem, providing artists with an intuitive, powerful tool for managing visual references. In this
                comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through everything you need to know to master RefBoard.
            </p>

            <h2>Getting Started with RefBoard</h2>

            <h3>1. Sign In and Create Your First Board</h3>
            <p>
                To begin using RefBoard, visit <a href="https://refboard.github.io"
                    style="color: #60a5fa">refboard.github.io</a> and click the "Get Started" button. You'll be prompted
                to sign in with your Google account - this integration allows RefBoard to securely store your images in
                your personal Google Drive, giving you full control over your data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once signed in, you'll see your dashboard. Click "New Board" to create your first reference board. Give
                it a descriptive name - for example, "Character Design - Fantasy Warrior" or "Color Palette Research".
                Good naming helps you stay organized as your collection of boards grows.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Adding Images to Your Board</h3>
            <p>
                There are several ways to add reference images to your board:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Drag and Drop:</strong> The easiest method is to drag images directly from your file
                    explorer or browser onto the canvas.</li>
                <li><strong>Upload Button:</strong> Click the upload button in the toolbar to select multiple files at
                    once from your computer.</li>
                <li><strong>Paste from Clipboard:</strong> Copy an image (Ctrl+C) and paste it directly onto the canvas
                    (Ctrl+V).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                RefBoard supports all major image formats including JPG, PNG, GIF, and even animated WebP files. You can
                also add videos in MP4 or WebM format, which is perfect for studying motion and animation references.
            </p>

            <h2>Organizing Your References</h2>

            <h3>The Infinite Canvas</h3>
            <p>
                Unlike traditional mood board tools that force you into a grid layout, RefBoard gives you an infinite
                canvas to work with. This means you can spread out your references spatially in whatever way makes sense
                for your project. Many artists organize references by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Topic or theme (characters, environments, props)</li>
                <li>Stage of development (inspiration, rough studies, final references)</li>
                <li>Color schemes or visual styles</li>
                <li>Chronological progression of ideas</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Navigation and Zoom</h3>
            <p>
                Navigating your board is intuitive and smooth. Hold the Space bar and drag with your mouse to pan around
                the canvas. Use your mouse wheel to zoom in and out - RefBoard maintains crisp image quality at all zoom
                levels, from a bird's-eye view of your entire board down to pixel-level detail.
            </p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use the minimap in the bottom-right corner to quickly navigate to different
                areas of large boards. Click anywhere on the minimap to instantly jump to that location.
            </div>

            <h3>Grouping Related Images</h3>
            <p>
                One of RefBoard's most powerful features is the ability to group related images together. To create a
                group:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Select multiple images by clicking and dragging a selection box around them</li>
                <li>Press Ctrl+G (Cmd+G on Mac) or click the "Group" button</li>
                <li>Give your group a name like "Armor References" or "Lighting Studies"</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Groups can be moved, resized, and even nested within other groups. This hierarchical organization allows
                you to build complex reference collections while keeping everything manageable. Groups also have colored
                borders that you can customize to visually distinguish different categories at a glance.
            </p>

            <h2>Advanced Features</h2>

            <h3>Collaboration and Sharing</h3>
            <p>
                RefBoard shines when working with teams. Click the Share button to invite collaborators by email. You
                can grant view-only access for clients or stakeholders, or edit access for team members who need to add
                their own references. Changes sync in real-time, so everyone sees updates immediately.
            </p>

            <h3>Export and Presentation</h3>
            <p>
                When you're ready to present your board or use it in another application, RefBoard offers several export
                options. You can export your entire board as a high-resolution PNG image, perfect for presentation
                slides or printing. Individual images can be downloaded by right-clicking on them, and you can export
                board data as JSON for backup purposes.
            </p>

            <h3>Search and Filter</h3>
            <p>
                As your boards grow to hundreds of images, finding specific references becomes crucial. RefBoard's
                search feature lets you filter images by filename, group name, or tags you've added. This makes it easy
                to quickly locate that one perfect reference you remember adding weeks ago.
            </p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Artists</h2>

            <h3>1. Start Broad, Then Focus</h3>
            <p>
                Begin your reference collection by gathering a wide variety of images related to your project. Don't
                worry about perfect organization at first - just get everything onto the canvas. Once you have a good
                collection, start organizing into groups and removing less relevant references.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Use Multiple Boards</h3>
            <p>
                Instead of cramming everything into one massive board, create separate boards for different aspects of
                your project. For a character design project, you might have:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A board for overall character inspiration and mood</li>
                <li>A board specifically for costume and armor references</li>
                <li>A board for color palette exploration</li>
                <li>A board for pose and anatomy studies</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Regular Cleanup</h3>
            <p>
                As your project evolves, some references become less relevant. Regularly review your board and remove or
                archive outdated references. This keeps your board focused and prevents overwhelming visual clutter that
                can slow down your creative decision-making.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                RefBoard transforms the way digital artists work with reference images. By providing an infinite canvas,
                powerful organization tools, and seamless collaboration features, it eliminates the frustration of
                managing references across multiple tools and folders. Whether you're a character designer, concept
                artist, illustrator, or any other creative professional, RefBoard adapts to your workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
                The key to mastering RefBoard is to start simple and gradually explore its features as your needs grow.
                Begin with basic image placement and navigation, then experiment with grouping, sharing, and advanced
                organization as you become more comfortable. Most importantly, make RefBoard a central part of your
                creative process - the more you use it, the more efficient and organized your workflow becomes.
