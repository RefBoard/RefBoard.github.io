                <div class="faq-question">What is RefBoard?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    RefBoard is a powerful reference board tool designed specifically for artists, designers, and
                    creative professionals. It allows you to organize, manage, and view reference images in a
                    customizable workspace. Unlike traditional mood boards, RefBoard offers advanced features like
                    infinite canvas, zoom controls, grouping, and real-time collaboration, making it the perfect tool
                    for character design, concept art, and creative projects.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Is RefBoard free to use?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Yes! RefBoard is completely free to use. You can access the web version at refboard.github.io or
                    download the desktop application for Windows. All core features including
                    unlimited boards, image uploads, and Google Drive integration are available at no cost. We believe
                    in providing powerful tools to the creative community without barriers.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How do I create my first board?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Creating your first board is simple! After signing in with your Google account, click the "New
                    Board" button on the dashboard. Give your board a name (like "Character Design" or "Color Palette"),
                    and you'll be taken to an infinite canvas where you can start adding reference images. You can drag
                    and drop images directly onto the canvas, or use the upload button to select multiple files at once.

                <div class="faq-question">What file formats does RefBoard support?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    RefBoard supports all major image and video formats. For images, you can upload JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP,
                    and SVG files. For videos, we support MP4, WebM, and MOV formats. There's no file size limit for
                    images, though we recommend keeping individual files under 50MB for optimal performance. All files
                    are stored securely in your Google Drive.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How do I organize images on my board?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    RefBoard offers multiple ways to organize your references. You can freely position images anywhere
                    on the infinite canvas by dragging them. Use the grouping feature to create collections of related
                    images - simply select multiple items and press Ctrl+G (Cmd+G on Mac). You can resize images
                    individually, rotate them, and even create nested groups. The search and filter features help you
                    quickly find specific references in larger boards.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Can I collaborate with others on a board?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Yes! RefBoard supports real-time collaboration. To share a board, click the "Share" button in the
                    top-right corner and add collaborators by their email addresses. You can set permissions to
                    view-only or edit access. Multiple users can work on the same board simultaneously, with changes
                    syncing in real-time. This makes RefBoard perfect for team projects, art direction, and remote
                    collaboration.

                <div class="faq-question">What are the keyboard shortcuts?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    RefBoard has many keyboard shortcuts for efficient workflow: Space+Drag to pan the canvas, Mouse
                    Wheel to zoom, Ctrl+Z/Y for undo/redo, Ctrl+G to group selected items, Delete to remove items, and
                    Ctrl+A to select all. Hold Shift while resizing to maintain aspect ratio. Press Ctrl+D to duplicate
                    selected items. For a complete list, visit our keyboard shortcuts guide in the documentation.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Where are my images stored?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    All your images are stored securely in your personal Google Drive account. When you upload an image
                    to RefBoard, it's automatically saved to a dedicated "RefBoard" folder in your Drive. This means you
                    have full control over your data, and your images don't take up space on our servers. You can access
                    these files directly from Google Drive at any time, and they count toward your Google Drive storage
                    quota.

                <div class="faq-question">Is my data safe and private?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Absolutely. RefBoard takes privacy seriously. We use Google's secure OAuth authentication and only
                    request the minimum necessary permissions. Your board data is stored in your own Google Drive
                    account, encrypted in transit and at rest. We never sell or share your data with third parties. You
                    can revoke RefBoard's access to your Google account at any time through your Google Account
                    settings. For more details, please review our Privacy Policy.

                <div class="faq-question">Can I export my boards?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Yes! You can export your boards in multiple formats. Use the "Export" menu to save your entire board
                    as a high-resolution PNG image, perfect for presentations or printing. You can also export board
                    data as JSON for backup purposes or to transfer boards between accounts. Individual images can be
                    downloaded directly from the board by right-clicking on them.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What browsers are supported?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    RefBoard works best on modern browsers. We officially support the latest versions of Google Chrome,
                    Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. For the best experience, we recommend using Chrome or
                    Edge, as they offer the best performance for our canvas rendering engine. The desktop application
                    (built with Electron) provides native performance on Windows.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">I'm experiencing slow performance, what can I do?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    If RefBoard feels slow, try these solutions: First, close other browser tabs to free up memory.
                    Second, reduce the number of high-resolution images on a single board - consider creating multiple
                    boards for large projects. Third, use the desktop application instead of the web version for better
                    performance. Fourth, enable hardware acceleration in your browser settings. If issues persist,
                    contact our support team with details about your system and browser.
